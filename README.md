PlayWright QA Testing Journey

> Note to Self: First time doing an actual fully fledge QA job. Previously, I only did it as around a half in my intern. This project will fill in the other half and the current half that I already know/think about. Think of it as just polishing my current skills to be even better.

This was done on linux. I don't feel like making **Webkit** available to use and downloading all the deps for it. If necessary I will, but it isn't so I won't make this more complicated than it needs to be. So **Webkit** would just be commented out in the config.
